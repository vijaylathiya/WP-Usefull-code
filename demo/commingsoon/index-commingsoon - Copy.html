    <h1>Prevention is better than cure</h1>

<h2>A Personal Protective Equipment Company</h2>

<h3>HeroLife is determined to save lives by providing preventive solutions that are trusted and effective.</h3>
<h3>MADE IN AMERICA, BY THE AMERICANS, FOR THE AMERICANS</h3>
<h3>FULLY AUTOMATIC PRECISION MANUFACTURING</h3>

<h4>The Problem:</h4>
<p>Health Care Supply Chain that relied on "as ready" production models for essential products,
which was capable of handling demands dictated by normal times. This fragile, antiquated,
invisible supply chain for multi-billion health care providers was a catastrophic failure. It
collapsed under the load. We have learned a very sobering lesson from COVID-19, just how
vulnerable and fractured the Health Care supply chain infrastructure in our country. This
system puts workers, patients, and the general public at risk for the shortage and inferior
quality of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) available from the 3rd world.</p>

<h4>Our Solution:</h4>
<p>The solution to the problem is creating a point to point fully visible supply chain of Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE) here at home that puts the health care service providers and the
general public first.</p>


<h4>About Hero:</h4>
<p>"American lives are valuable, and our California based company is determined to help save lives," "The search for PPE products should not add to an already overburdened stress level. </p>
<p>Disposable face masks are products each of us will need to wear every day until there is a solution. Until there's a cure, there is only prevention. </p>
<p>Our company is meeting this challenge head-on by increasing production in our Corona City manufacturing facility to serve the 40 billion disposable face masks market. We want you to know and trust where your masks are coming from â€“ made in America, by Americans, for Americans." </p>
<p>Hero Life Sciences is an initiative of AV Ventures, a designer of apparels distributed across the United States and Bliss Solutions, a company that provides solutions around personal development. The venture is focusing on manufacturing 3 ply disposable face masks in boxes of 20 and 50. These masks will be suitable for men, women and children of all ages. </p>
<p>Hero Life Sciences' disposable face masks will be available for purchase by consumers, organizations and frontline workers by the beginning of September 2020.</p>
